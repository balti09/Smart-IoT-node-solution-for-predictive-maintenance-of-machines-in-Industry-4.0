# Smart-IoT-node-solution-for-predictive-maintenance-of-machines-in-Industry-4.0

This project consists of creating an intelligent IoT node in order to allow real-time supervision of machines in industry 4.0.
This node integrating a sensors, an embedded processor (or microcontroller) and a wireless communication module,
the  wireless communication module, is used to collect data, perform ML processing and transmit the calculation result to an appropriate cloud platform over the Internet.

Hardware equipment: 
- STM32L475 Discovery node
Software equipment :
- STM32CUBE IDE
-STM32 cubeMX
